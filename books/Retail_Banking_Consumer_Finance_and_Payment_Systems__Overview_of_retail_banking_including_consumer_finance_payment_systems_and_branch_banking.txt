Overview of Retail Banking
The History of Retail Banking
Retail banking, also known as consumer banking, is the provision of financial services to individuals and small businesses. It involves a wide range of financial products and services, including deposit accounts, lending, credit cards, payment systems, and investment services. The history of retail banking dates back to the early 19th century, with significant transformations over the years. This chapter provides an overview of the evolution of retail banking from traditional banking to modern digital banking.
**Traditional Banking (1800s-1970s)**
In the early 19th century, banking was primarily focused on serving the needs of the wealthy and large corporations. Retail banking emerged as a distinct segment of the financial services industry in the late 19th century, particularly in the United States. The first savings bank was established in 1816 in New York, marking the beginning of retail banking. The primary objective of these early savings banks was to encourage thrift among the working class by providing a safe and accessible means of saving. The services offered were limited, and banking was largely a manual process.
The early 20th century saw the rise of commercial banks, which offered a broader range of financial services, including lending and deposit accounts. The 1920s and 1930s witnessed significant growth in retail banking, with the establishment of bank branches in suburban areas and the introduction of new financial products such as personal loans and credit cards. The post-World War II period saw increased consumer spending, leading to further expansion of retail banking.
**Deregulation and Technological Advancements (1980s-1990s)**
The 1980s and 1990s were marked by significant deregulation in the banking industry. The Depositor Preference Statute of 1989 and the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) led to increased competition among banks. The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Community Development Legislation of 1994 and the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (also known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act) further expanded the scope of banking activities. These laws allowed banks to engage in a wide range of financial activities, including insurance and investment banking.
Technological advancements also played a crucial role in transforming retail banking. The introduction of automated teller machines (ATMs) in the 1960s and electronic funds transfer (EFT) systems in the 1970s enabled banks to provide 24/7 banking services. The widespread adoption of personal computers and the internet in the 1980s and 1990s facilitated the development of online banking, enabling customers to manage their accounts remotely.
**Digital Banking (2000s-Present)**
The 21st century has seen a significant shift towards digital banking. The proliferation of smartphones and mobile devices has enabled banks to offer a wide range of financial services through mobile applications. Digital banking has transformed the way banks interact with their customers, enabling remote account opening, fund transfers, bill payments, and investment services. The use of data analytics and artificial intelligence has also improved customer service and enabled banks to offer personalized financial products.
The rise of fintech companies has disrupted traditional banking models, offering innovative financial products and services. Banks have responded by adopting digital technologies and collaborating with fintech companies. The use of blockchain technology has the potential to further transform the financial services industry, enabling secure and efficient transactions.
**Case Study: The Digital Transformation of Banking**
In 2017, JPMorgan Chase launched Finn, a mobile banking app designed for millennials. The app allows users to open a bank account, deposit checks, pay bills, and track spending. The app's user-friendly interface and lack of fees have attracted a large number of young customers. In 2019, JPMorgan Chase expanded the availability of Finn to all U.S. customers.

Retail Banking Consumer Finance and Payment Systems - Overview of Retail Banking - Retail Banking Business Model
Retail Banking Business Model
Retail banking, also known as consumer banking, refers to the provision of financial services to individual consumers rather than corporate clients. The primary goal of retail banking is to provide financial products and services to individuals and small businesses, focusing on deposits, lending, payment systems, and investment services. The retail banking business model is built on the concept of aggregating deposits from a large number of individuals and small businesses and lending to a smaller number of borrowers. The difference between the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits, known as the net interest spread, is the primary source of revenue for retail banks.
Revenue Streams
The primary revenue streams for retail banks include:
• Interest rates charged on loans to customers, which are typically higher than the interest rates paid on deposits from customers. This difference is known as the net interest spread.
• Fees charged for various financial services, such as account maintenance, ATM usage, credit card transactions, and loan applications.
• Commissions earned from selling financial products, such as insurance policies, mutual funds, and other investment vehicles.
• Interest rates charged on credit card balances.
• Fees charged for payment processing services, such as credit card transactions.
Cost Structures
The primary cost structures for retail banks include:
• Interest rates paid on deposits from customers.
• Salaries and benefits paid to employees.
• Occupancy and equipment costs for bank branches.
• Marketing and advertising expenses.
• Technology and system maintenance costs.
• Provision for loan losses.
• Regulatory fees and taxes.
Retail Banking Products and Services
Retail banks offer a wide range of financial products and services, including:
• Deposit accounts, such as savings accounts, checking accounts, and time deposits.
• Lending products, such as personal loans, credit cards, home loans, and auto loans.
• Payment systems, such as credit cards, debit cards, and prepaid cards.
• Investment products, such as mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and insurance policies.
• Financial advisory services, such as investment advice and portfolio management.
Retail Banking Business Model Challenges
• Competition from other financial institutions, such as commercial banks, savings and loans associations, credit unions, and finance companies.
• Competition from non-banking financial intermediaries, such as investment banks, mutual funds, insurance companies, and other financial intermediaries.
• Regulatory requirements, such as capital requirements, deposit insurance, and consumer protection laws.
• Technological advancements, such as mobile banking and digital payments, which require significant investments in technology and infrastructure.
• Economic conditions, such as interest rates, inflation, and unemployment, which can affect loan demand and deposit levels.
Case Study: Retail Banking in the Digital Age
The retail banking industry has undergone significant changes in recent years, driven by technological advancements and changing consumer preferences. The proliferation of mobile devices and the internet has enabled banks to offer a wide range of financial services through digital channels, reducing the need for physical bank branches. This shift has also enabled banks to reduce costs associated with maintaining a large branch network.
For example, mobile banking apps allow customers to check account balances, transfer funds, and pay bills remotely. Digital payments systems, such as mobile wallets and contactless payment cards, have also become increasingly popular, enabling customers to make transactions without the need for physical currency or cards.
In addition, banks have leveraged data analytics and machine learning to improve customer targeting and to offer personalized financial services. For instance, banks can use data analytics to identify customers who are likely to require a loan or other financial services and to offer such services proactively.
However, the shift to digital banking also presents challenges for retail banks. For instance, the proliferation of digital banking channels has increased the risk of cyber-attacks and data breaches, which can result in significant financial losses and damage to a bank's reputation. Furthermore, the shift to digital banking requires significant investments in technology and infrastructure, which can be costly and time-consuming.
In conclusion, the retail banking business model is built on the concept of aggregating deposits from a large number of individuals and small businesses and lending to a smaller number of borrowers. The primary revenue streams for retail banks include interest rates charged on loans, fees charged for financial services, commissions earned from selling financial products, interest rates charged on credit card balances, and fees charged for payment processing services. The primary cost structures for retail banks include interest rates paid on deposits, salaries and benefits paid to employees, occupancy and equipment costs for bank branches, marketing and advertising expenses, technology and system maintenance costs, provision for loan losses, and regulatory fees and taxes. The retail banking business model faces several challenges, including competition from other financial institutions, regulatory requirements, technological advancements, and economic conditions.
The Mechanics of Credit Cards
Credit cards are a type of revolving credit facility that allows cardholders to borrow funds from the card issuer to finance purchases, pay bills, or obtain cash advances. Credit cards have become an essential part of modern consumer finance, offering a convenient payment method and a means to build credit history. However, they also involve interest rates, fees, and other charges that can be detrimental to the cardholder's financial health if not managed properly.
Interest Rates
Interest rates charged on credit cards vary widely depending on the type of card, the cardholder's credit score, and the issuer's policies. Interest rates can be fixed or variable, and they may change over time based on market conditions or the cardholder's payment history. Credit card interest rates are generally higher than other forms of consumer credit, such as personal loans or mortgages, because they are unsecured and involve higher credit risk.
Interest rates are typically expressed as an annual percentage rate (APR). The APR includes both interest and fees charged by the lender, expressed as a yearly rate. Credit card interest rates can range from around 10% to over 30%. Some credit cards may offer promotional interest rates that are lower than the regular interest rate for a limited period, usually as an incentive to attract new customers or to encourage existing customers to use their cards more frequently.
Interest rates are applied to outstanding balances when cardholders fail to pay their bills in full by the due date. Interest accrues daily and is typically charged monthly. Interest rates can be calculated in different ways, including:
1. Daily Periodic Rate: This method involves dividing the APR by 365 to calculate the daily interest rate. Interest is then charged on the outstanding balance each day.
3. Monthly Periodic Rate: This method involves dividing the APR by 12 to calculate the monthly interest rate. Interest is then charged on the outstanding balance each month.
4. Average Daily Balance Method: This method involves calculating the average daily balance by adding the beginning and ending balances for the billing period and dividing by two. Interest is then charged on the average daily balance.
Fees
Credit cards often involve various fees, including:
1. Annual Fee: A yearly fee charged by the card issuer for the use of the credit card. Annual fees can range from $25 to over $500.
2. Interest Charges: Interest rates charged on outstanding balances when cardholders fail to pay their bills in full by the due date.
3. Late Payment Fee: A fee charged when cardholders fail to make payments on time. Late payment fees can range from $25 to $35.
4. Foreign Transaction Fee: A fee charged on transactions made in foreign currencies. Foreign transaction fees are typically 1% to 3% of the transaction amount.
5. Balance Transfer Fee: A fee charged when cardholders transfer their outstanding balance from one credit card to another. Balance transfer fees are typically 3% to 5% of the transferred amount.
6. Cash Advance Fee: A fee charged when cardholders obtain cash advances using their credit cards. Cash advance fees are typically 3% to 5% of the advanced amount.
7. Overlimit Fee: A fee charged when cardholders exceed their credit limit. Overlimit fees are typically $25 to $35.
8. Credit Card Interest Rate Reduction Fee: A fee charged by some credit card issuers when cardholders request a temporary reduction in their interest rate.
150. Credit Card
Personal loans are a type of consumer credit that allows individuals to borrow money for various personal purposes. These loans are typically unsecured, meaning they are not backed by collateral, and are repaid through fixed monthly installments. Personal loans are offered by banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions. There are several types of personal loans, each with its own characteristics and benefits.
**Installment Loans**
Installment loans are the most common type of personal loan. These loans involve borrowing a fixed amount of money and repaying it through a series of fixed monthly payments over a set period of time. The repayment period can range from a few months to several years. Interest rates vary depending on the lender, the borrower's credit score, and the loan amount. Installment loans are often used for large purchases, such as buying a car or financing a wedding.
**Lines of Credit**
A line of credit is a type of personal loan that allows the borrower to access funds as needed. Unlike installment loans, lines of credit do not involve fixed monthly payments. Instead, the borrower pays interest only on the amount borrowed and can repay the principal at any time. Lines of credit are often used for ongoing expenses, such as home renovations or education.
**Peer-to-Peer Lending**
Peer-to-peer lending, also known as P2P lending, is a type of personal loan that matches borrowers with investors. Platforms like Lending Club and Prosper facilitate P2P lending by allowing individuals to lend money to other individuals. P2P lending offers lower interest rates than traditional banks and credit cards, making it an attractive option for borrowers. However, P2P lending carries more risk for lenders due to the lack of collateral and credit checks.
**Case Study: Personal Loan for Home Renovation**
John, a 35-year-old software engineer, needs to finance a home renovation project that will cost $20,000. He considers taking out a personal loan from a bank, but the interest rate is 12%. He then looks into peer-to-peer lending and finds a platform that offers a 9% interest rate. John decides to borrow $20,000 through the P2P lending platform and repays the loan over 36 months. He pays $599 per month, which includes interest and fees. The total cost of the loan is $21,500.
**Case Study: Personal Loan for Car Purchase**
Emily, a 28-year-old marketing manager, needs to buy a new car. She finds a car she likes for $25,000. She has a good credit score and qualifies for a 5% interest rate on a 60-month installment loan from a bank. She pays $436 per month, which includes interest and fees. The total cost of the loan is $26,160.

Payment processing is a critical component of payment systems, encompassing the technical aspects of transactions from authorization to settlement. This process involves multiple stakeholders, including banks, payment processors, card associations, and merchants. Understanding the payment processing flow is essential for financial professionals to appreciate the complexity and efficiency of modern payment systems.
**Authorization**
Payment processing begins with authorization, where the customer initiates a transaction by presenting their payment method, such as a credit card, debit card, or mobile wallet. The merchant's point-of-sale (POS) system or online payment gateway communicates with the payment processor to verify the customer's account details and ensure sufficient funds. The payment processor, in turn, contacts the customer's bank to request authorization for the transaction. The bank responds with an authorization code, which is then relayed back to the merchant. This code serves as confirmation that the transaction is approved, pending settlement.
**Clearing**
After authorization, the transaction enters the clearing phase. The merchant's bank, known as the acquiring bank, collects authorized transactions and prepares them for settlement. The acquiring bank forwards the transactions to the payment processor for processing. The payment processor sorts transactions by card type and prepares them for submission to the relevant card association, such as Visa or Mastercard. The card association facilitates the exchange of financial information between banks on behalf of their customers. The card association charges the acquiring bank a fee for each transaction processed.
**Settlement**
In the settlement phase, the card association transfers funds from the customer's bank, known as the issuing bank, to the acquiring bank. The issuing bank debits the customer's account for the transaction amount plus any applicable fees. The acquiring bank credits the merchant's account for the transaction amount minus any fees charged by the acquiring bank and the payment processor. Settlement typically occurs within 24 to 48 hours after authorization.
**Payment Processing Flow**
The following diagram illustrates the payment processing flow:
1. Customer initiates transaction at merchant's POS or online payment gateway.
2. Merchant's POS or payment gateway communicates with payment processor for authorization.
3. Payment processor requests authorization from customer's bank.
4. Customer's bank responds with authorization code.
5. Payment processor relays authorization code to merchant.
6. Merchant's bank collects authorized transactions and prepares them for settlement.
7. Merchant's bank forwards transactions to payment processor for processing.
8. Payment processor sorts transactions by card type and prepares them for submission to card association.
9. Card association facilitates exchange of financial information between banks.
10. Card association transfers funds from customer's bank to merchant's bank.
11. Customer's bank debits customer's account for transaction amount plus fees.
12. Merchant's bank credits merchant's account for transaction amount minus fees.
**Payment Processing Fees**
Payment processing involves fees charged by various stakeholders. These fees include:
- Interchange fees: charged by the card association to the acquiring bank for each transaction processed.
- Acquiring fees: charged by the acquiring bank to the merchant for each transaction processed.
- Payment processor fees: charged by the payment processor to the acquiring bank for each transaction processed.
- Issuing fees: charged by the card association to the issuing bank for each transaction processed.
**Payment Processing Technologies**
Payment processing relies on various technologies to facilitate transactions efficiently. These technologies include:
- Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS): encrypt data transmitted between parties to prevent unauthorized access.
- Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS): a set of security standards designed to ensure that all companies that handle credit card information maintain a secure environment.
- Tokenization: replaces sensitive payment information with unique identification symbols called tokens.
- Chip technology: embedded microchips in payment cards provide an additional layer of security to prevent fraud.
- Contactless payments: allow customers to make transactions by tapping their payment cards or mobile devices on a POS terminal.
- Mobile wallets: digital containers that store payment information and provide a convenient alternative to physical payment methods.
**Case Study: Apple Pay**
Apple Pay is a mobile wallet that enables users to make contactless payments in-store and in-app. Apple Pay uses tokenization to replace sensitive payment information with unique identification symbols called tokens. When a user adds a credit or debit card to Apple Pay, the card information is encrypted and sent to Apple's servers. Apple then replaces the actual card information with a token, which is stored securely on the user's device. When a user initiates a transaction, the token is sent to the payment processor, which then requests authorization from the customer's bank. The bank responds with an authorization code, which is relayed back to the user's device. The user authenticates the transaction using Touch ID or Face ID, and the transaction is processed as usual.
**Case Study: PayPal**
PayPal is an online payment system that enables users to send and receive payments. PayPal acts as a payment processor and acquiring bank for online transactions. When a user initiates a transaction, PayPal requests authorization from the customer's bank. The bank responds with an authorization code, which is relayed back to PayPal. PayPal then facilitates the settlement of the transaction, transferring funds from the customer's bank to the merchant's bank. PayPal charges fees to both the customer and the merchant for each transaction processed.
**Payment Processing Challenges and Opportunities**
- Security risks: payment processing involves sensitive financial information, making it a prime target for fraud and cyber-attacks.
- Interoperability: payment systems must be able to communicate seamlessly with various stakeholders, including banks, payment processors, and card associations.
- Competition: payment processing is a competitive industry, with numerous payment processors and payment methods vying for market share.
- Regulatory compliance: payment processing must comply with numerous regulations, including PCI DSS and anti-money laundering regulations.
Despite these challenges, payment processing offers opportunities for innovation, including:
- Increased efficiency: payment processing can be optimized to reduce transaction times and improve customer experience.
- Cost reduction: payment processing can be optimized to reduce fees charged to merchants and customers.
- New payment methods: emerging technologies, such as blockchain and cryptocurrencies, offer new payment methods that can potentially disrupt traditional payment processing.
**Conclusion**
Payment Systems
Payment systems are the backbone of modern commerce, enabling the exchange of goods and services between buyers and sellers. The efficiency and security of payment systems are critical to the functioning of economies worldwide. In this chapter, we will explore the various payment methods used in retail banking consumer finance, including cash, credit cards, debit cards, and mobile payments.
Payment Methods
Cash
Cash is the most basic and widely used payment method. It involves the physical exchange of currency notes or coins for goods and services. Cash is accepted by almost all merchants and is the preferred payment method for many transactions, especially for small-value purchases. However, cash transactions have limitations, such as the need to carry sufficient amounts, the risk of loss or theft, and the difficulty of tracking transactions.
Credit cards are a popular payment method that allows cardholders to borrow funds from the card issuer to finance purchases. Credit cards offer several benefits, including convenience, credit facilities, and rewards programs. Credit cards are widely accepted by merchants and provide a level of consumer protection against fraudulent transactions. However, credit cards also involve interest charges, fees, and the risk of overspending.
Debit Cards
Debit cards are linked to a bank account and allow cardholders to make purchases by deducting funds directly from their account. Debit cards are similar to credit cards but do not involve borrowing. They are widely accepted by merchants and provide a convenient alternative to cash. Debit cards are also subject to fees, and cardholders must have sufficient funds in their accounts to complete transactions.
Mobile Payments
Mobile payments involve using mobile devices, such as smartphones or tablets, to initiate and authorize payment transactions. Mobile payments can be made using various technologies, including near-field communication (NFC), quick response (QR) codes, and text messages. Mobile payments offer several benefits, including convenience, speed, and enhanced security. They are increasingly being used for transactions such as bill payments, online purchases, and in-store payments.
Apple Pay is a mobile payment service that allows users to make payments using their iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, or Mac. Apple Pay uses NFC technology to transmit payment information to point-of-sale terminals, eliminating the need to physically present a payment card. Apple Pay offers enhanced security features, including Touch ID or Face ID authentication and tokenization, which replaces actual credit or debit card numbers with unique device account numbers. Apple Pay has been adopted by millions of users worldwide and is accepted by a growing number of merchants.

Retail Banking Consumer Finance and Payment Systems - Branch Banking - The Future of Branch Banking
The role of physical bank branches in the digital age.
The banking industry has undergone significant changes in recent years, with the rise of digital banking and the increasing use of technology in financial services. This shift has led to a reevaluation of the role of physical bank branches in the banking system. While some argue that bank branches are no longer necessary, others believe that they continue to play a vital role in providing financial services to customers. This chapter explores the future of branch banking, examining the current state of the industry, the challenges it faces, and the opportunities that exist for banks to transform their branch networks.
The Current State of Branch Banking
The traditional bank branch model has been in existence for over a century. It typically consists of a physical location where customers can conduct financial transactions, seek financial advice, and access other banking services. The branch is usually staffed by bank employees who provide customer service and support. The branch model has been the cornerstone of banking for many years, but it faces significant challenges in the digital age.
The rise of digital banking has led to a decline in the number of bank branches in many countries. In the United States, for example, the number of bank branches decreased by 12% between 2009 and 2017, from 90,000 to 80,000. This trend is expected to continue as more customers turn to digital channels for their banking needs. According to a survey by the American Banking Association, 71% of Americans prefer to bank online, and 43% prefer to bank on their mobile devices.
The decline of bank branches is not limited to the United States. In Europe, the number of bank branches has decreased by 20% since 2008, from 240,000 to 190,000. This trend is expected to continue as banks seek to reduce costs and improve efficiency. In Asia, the number of bank branches has increased, but this growth has been driven primarily by banks in China.
The Challenges of Branch Banking
The decline of bank branches is driven by several factors, including:
• Decline in Deposit Levels: The use of digital banking channels has reduced the need for customers to physically visit bank branches to deposit funds. As a result, deposit levels have declined, making it more difficult for banks to generate interest income.
• Increased Competition: The banking industry is highly competitive, and banks face competition from other financial institutions, as well as from non-banks such as fintech companies. This competition has led banks to seek ways to reduce costs and improve efficiency.
• Changing Customer Behavior: Customers are increasingly using digital channels for their banking needs, reducing the need for physical bank branches.
• Regulatory Pressures: Banks are subject to significant regulatory pressures, including capital requirements, anti-money laundering regulations, and data protection requirements. These regulations increase the cost of doing business and make it more difficult for banks to maintain a large branch network.
• Technological Advancements: Advances in technology have enabled banks to provide a wide range of financial services remotely. This has reduced the need for physical bank branches and has enabled banks to reduce costs.
The Opportunities of Branch Banking
Despite the challenges facing the banking industry, physical bank branches continue to play an important role in providing financial services to customers. Banks are transforming their branch networks to meet the changing needs of their customers. Some of the opportunities that exist for banks include:
• Digital Transformation: Banks are investing heavily in digital transformation initiatives, including the development of mobile banking apps, online banking platforms, and digital payment systems. These initiatives enable banks to provide financial services to customers remotely, reducing the need for physical bank branches.
• Omnichannel Banking: Banks are seeking to provide customers with a seamless banking experience across all channels, including online, mobile, and physical bank branches. This requires banks to invest in digital technologies that enable them to provide consistent services across all channels.
• Financial Inclusion: Physical bank branches provide financial services to underserved communities that do not have access to digital banking channels. Banks are seeking to expand financial inclusion by providing financial services to these communities.
• Relationship Banking: Physical bank branches provide banks with an opportunity to build relationships with their customers. This is particularly important for customers who require complex financial services, such as loans and investment advice.
• Cross-Selling Opportunities: Physical bank branches provide banks with opportunities to cross-sell financial products and services to their customers.
Case Studies

Banks will need to continue to invest in digital technologies that enable them to provide financial services remotely, while also maintaining a physical presence in the communities they serve. The following are some of the trends that will shape the future of branch banking:
• Relationship Banking: Banks will continue to invest in relationship banking, providing customers with high-quality financial services and advice. This will be particularly important for customers who require complex financial services, such as loans and investment advice.
• Cross-Selling Opportunities: Banks will continue to seek opportunities to cross-sell financial products and services to their customers.
• Branch Consolidation: Banks will continue to consolidate their branch networks, reducing the number of physical bank branches in response to declining deposit levels and increased competition.

Another significant development was the introduction of mobile banking. This allowed customers to perform banking transactions using their mobile phones. Mobile banking has become increasingly popular, especially among younger customers who are comfortable using mobile devices to perform financial transactions.
In addition to improving customer convenience, banks have also focused on reducing costs. One of the key initiatives was the introduction of deposit-taking ATMs. These machines allow customers to deposit cash or checks into their accounts without the need for bank tellers. This has significantly reduced the need for bank tellers and has allowed banks to reduce their overhead costs.

Retail Banking Consumer Finance and Payment Systems - Global Retail Banking - Retail Banking in Emerging Markets
The retail banking sector in emerging markets faces unique challenges and opportunities. These markets often have large unbanked populations, limited financial infrastructure, and varying levels of economic development. Despite these challenges, emerging markets offer significant growth potential for retail banks. This chapter explores the key aspects of retail banking in emerging markets, including consumer finance, payment systems, and the role of technology in expanding financial inclusion.
Consumer Finance
Consumer finance in emerging markets is characterized by a high demand for credit, driven by the need for consumer goods and services. However, the lack of credit history and collateral often makes it difficult for individuals to access credit from traditional financial institutions. As a result, many consumers turn to alternative sources of credit, such as informal money lenders, which can charge exorbitant interest rates. Retail banks in emerging markets have an opportunity to provide affordable credit to these consumers, thereby increasing financial inclusion.
Key Challenges:
• Limited credit history and collateral among consumers
• High demand for credit
• Competition from alternative credit sources
Key Opportunities:
• Increasing financial inclusion
• Providing affordable credit
• Expanding consumer credit portfolios
