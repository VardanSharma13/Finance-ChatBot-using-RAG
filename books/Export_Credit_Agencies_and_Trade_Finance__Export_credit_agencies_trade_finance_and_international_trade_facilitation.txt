Overview of Export Credit Agencies
History and Evolution
Export credit agencies (ECAs) have played a crucial role in facilitating international trade by providing financial support to domestic companies and foreign buyers. ECAs are government-backed financial institutions that provide credit facilities to foreign buyers for the purchase of goods and services from domestic companies. The primary objective of ECAs is to promote national exports by mitigating the risks associated with international trade. This section provides an overview of the history and evolution of ECAs, their role in facilitating international trade, and their impact on global commerce.
History of Export Credit Agencies
The concept of export credit agencies dates back to the early 20th century. The first ECA was established in 1919 in the United Kingdom, followed by the United States in 1934. The primary objective of these early ECAs was to promote national exports by providing credit facilities to foreign buyers. During the post-World War II era, ECAs expanded their services to include credit insurance, guarantees, and other financial products. The establishment of the Berne Union in 1934, an international association of ECAs, facilitated the exchange of information and best practices among member countries. The Berne Union also established common standards for credit risk assessment and claims handling.
In the 1960s and 1970s, ECAs expanded their services to include medium- and long-term credit facilities. This expansion was driven by the increasing complexity of international trade, particularly in the areas of capital goods and infrastructure projects. ECAs also began to provide credit facilities for foreign investments, such as foreign direct investments and joint ventures. The 1980s saw the emergence of private credit insurers, which competed with ECAs in providing credit insurance services. This competition led to the development of more sophisticated credit risk assessment techniques and more competitive pricing.
In the 1990s, ECAs began to provide services to banks and financial institutions. This included providing credit enhancements for trade finance transactions, such as letters of credit and bank loans. ECAs also expanded their services to include credit facilities for banks and financial institutions, enabling them to provide trade finance services to their customers. The 1990s also saw the emergence of export credit agencies in developing countries, particularly in Asia. These ECAs were established to promote national exports and to provide financial support to domestic companies.
In the 2000s, ECAs expanded their services to include services such as export financing, credit insurance, and investment insurance. ECAs also began to provide services to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which had previously been underserved by the financial services industry. The 2008 global financial crisis highlighted the importance of ECAs in facilitating international trade. ECAs played a critical role in maintaining trade flows during the crisis by providing credit facilities to foreign buyers and financial institutions.
Evolution of Export Credit Agencies
The evolution of ECAs has been driven by changes in the global economy, advances in technology, and shifts in government policies. The following are some of the key trends that have influenced the evolution of ECAs:
1. **Globalization**: The increasing globalization of trade has led to greater competition among ECAs. ECAs have expanded their services to include a broader range of financial products and services, such as export financing, credit insurance, and investment insurance.
2. **Financial Innovation**: Advances in financial technology have enabled ECAs to provide more sophisticated financial products and services. For example, the use of digital platforms has enabled ECAs to provide faster and more efficient services to their customers.
3. **Risk Management**: ECAs have developed more sophisticated credit risk assessment techniques, enabling them to provide credit facilities to a broader range of foreign buyers. ECAs have also developed techniques for managing credit risk, such as credit insurance and guarantees.
4. **Government Policies**: Government policies have played a significant role in shaping the evolution of ECAs. For example, governments have used ECAs as a tool to promote national exports and to provide financial support to domestic companies.
5. **Competition**: The emergence of private credit insurers has led to greater competition among ECAs. This competition has driven the development of more sophisticated credit risk assessment techniques and more competitive pricing.
6. **Regulatory Environment**: The regulatory environment in which ECAs operate has become more complex. ECAs must comply with a range of regulations, including those related to anti-bribery, money laundering, and environmental and social standards.
7. **Digitalization**: The increasing use of digital technologies has enabled ECAs to provide faster and more efficient services to their customers. ECAs are also using digital technologies to improve their credit risk assessment techniques and to manage their operations more efficiently.

Export Credit Agencies and Trade Finance - The Role of Export Credit Agencies in Trade Finance - Risk Management
Risk Management
Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk that a buyer will be unable to pay for goods or services. This risk is particularly high in international trade, where the buyer and seller are located in different countries and may have different laws and regulations. ECAs can provide credit insurance to protect against the risk of non-payment by the buyer. This insurance typically covers a percentage of the contract value and is usually payable in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, or failure of the buyer to pay.
For example, in 2018, the United States Export-Import Bank (EXIM) provided $5 billion in financing to support U.S. exports, including $1.1 billion in loan guarantees to support the sale of Boeing aircraft to Ethiopian Airlines. This financing helped Ethiopian Airlines to purchase 10 Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft, which were delivered in 2018 and 2019. The loan guarantees were provided to mitigate the credit risk associated with the sale.
Political Risk
Political risk refers to the risk that a government will take actions that prevent or delay payment or delivery of goods. This risk is particularly high in countries with a history of expropriation, nationalization, war, or other political instability. ECAs can provide insurance to protect against the risk of non-payment by the buyer due to political events. This insurance typically covers a percentage of the contract value and is usually payable in the event of expropriation, nationalization, war, or other political events that prevent payment or delivery.
For example, in 2017, the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) provided $4.8 billion in financing to support U.S. exports, including $1.5 billion in loan guarantees to support the sale of Boeing aircraft to Lion Air. This financing helped Lion Air to purchase 50 Boeing 737 MAX 10 aircraft, which were delivered in 2017 and 2018. The loan guarantees were provided to mitigate the political risk associated with the sale.
Other Perils
Other perils associated with international trade include natural disasters, trade embargoes, and changes in import or export regulations. ECAs can provide insurance to protect against these risks by providing reimbursement for losses due to these events. This insurance typically covers a percentage of the contract value and is usually payable in the event of loss due to these events.
For example, in 2018, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) provided financing to support the sale of Japanese machinery to a company in Mexico. The financing included insurance against natural disasters, such as earthquakes, which are common in Mexico. The insurance was provided to mitigate the risk associated with the sale.
Case Study: The Role of ECAs in Financing Large-Scale Projects
Large-scale projects, such as infrastructure development, often require significant financing. ECAs can play a crucial role in providing financing for these projects by providing insurance and other financial services. For example, in 2015, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) provided financing to support the construction of a high-speed rail project in Indonesia. The financing included insurance against natural disasters, such as earthquakes, which are common in Indonesia. The insurance was provided to mitigate the risk associated with the project.
In 2019, the Korea Trade Insurance Corporation (K-SURE) provided financing to support the construction of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Bangladesh. The financing included insurance against natural disasters, such as cyclones, which are common in Bangladesh. The insurance was provided to mitigate the risk associated with the project.
In 2020, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) provided financing to support the construction of a high-speed rail project in India. The financing included insurance against natural disasters, such as earthquakes, which are common in India. The insurance was provided to mitigate the risk associated with the project.
Financing Solutions
Direct Lending
Direct lending involves ECAs providing loans directly to foreign buyers for the purchase of goods or services from domestic sellers. This financing solution is often used for large capital equipment or infrastructure projects. ECAs can provide financing for up to 100% of the contract value, depending on the country of the buyer and the type of goods or services being exported. Direct lending is particularly useful for financing large, complex projects that require significant upfront investment and have long repayment terms.
For example, in 2018, the U.S. Export-Import Bank (EXIM) provided $34.7 million in direct lending to support the export of U.S.-manufactured locomotives to Egypt. The financing covered 85% of the contract price, enabling the U.S. company to compete effectively against other bidders.
Credit Insurance
Credit insurance provides protection to the seller against the risk of non-payment by the foreign buyer. ECAs offer credit insurance policies that cover both commercial and political risks associated with international trade. Commercial risks include insolvency of the buyer or failure of the buyer to pay for goods or services provided. Political risks include war, expropriation, nationalization, and other government actions that might prevent payment to the seller. Credit insurance policies generally cover 90% of the contract value, leaving the seller with a 10% risk. The credit insurance policy pays out to the seller in the event of a loss due to a covered risk.
For instance, in 2019, the Export Development Canada (EDC) provided credit insurance to a Canadian company exporting mining equipment to a buyer in Argentina. The credit insurance policy covered 90% of the contract value, allowing the Canadian company to offer competitive credit terms to the Argentine buyer. When the Argentine buyer was unable to pay due to a political and economic crisis in Argentina, the EDC paid out to the Canadian company under the credit insurance policy.
Bank Loans
ECAs can provide guarantees to banks for loans made to foreign buyers to finance purchases from domestic sellers. These guarantees are usually in the form of a promise to indemnify the banks in the event of loss due to a breach of any of the obligations of the buyer or any other party to the financial contracts. ECAs can provide guarantees for up to 100% of the contract value, depending on the country of the buyer and the type of goods or services being exported. The guarantee is usually in the form of a direct pay letter, which allows the bank to claim payment directly from the ECA in the event of a loss.
For example, in 2017, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) provided a guarantee to a bank for a loan to a foreign buyer of Japanese-made rolling stock. The guarantee covered 100% of the contract value, enabling the bank to provide financing to the foreign buyer on competitive terms. The guarantee also covered 100% of the contract value of the bank loans provided to the Japanese supplier to finance the production of the rolling stock.
In addition to these financing solutions, ECAs often provide other services to support international trade, including:
• Market research and identification of potential buyers
• Trade mission support and assistance
• Trade dispute resolution services
• Trade policy and advocacy services
• Foreign exchange insurance
• Working capital financing
• Bond financing
• Capital markets financing
• Credit enhancement and other support, such as collateral, for securitization of receivables
ECAs also provide a range of services to support the financing of international trade, including market research, trade mission support, trade dispute resolution, trade policy and advocacy, foreign exchange insurance, working capital financing, bond financing, capital markets financing, credit enhancement, and other support for securitization of receivables.

Trade Facilitation
Trade facilitation refers to the simplification, standardization, and harmonization of procedures and associated information flows required to complete international trade transactions. It involves the reduction of administrative burdens on importers and exporters by minimizing the complexity and cost of complying with import and export regulations. Trade facilitation can be achieved through the use of technology, such as electronic data interchange, and by implementing international standards for customs procedures. The benefits of trade facilitation include increased efficiency, reduced costs, and improved compliance with customs regulations.
The Role of Export Credit Agencies in Trade Facilitation
• Credit Guarantees: ECAs provide credit guarantees to banks and other financial institutions to cover the risk of non-payment by foreign buyers. These guarantees are often used in conjunction with credit insurance to provide additional protection against loss.
• Other Financial Products: ECAs offer a range of other financial products, including export loans, export credit refinancing facilities, and export financing facilities. These products help to finance export transactions and provide additional protection against loss.
For example, EXIM provided financing to support the sale of American-made locomotives to a foreign buyer. The financing included a combination of EXIM's export credit insurance and a loan facility. The insurance covered both commercial and political risks, including the insolvency of the buyer or the imposition of trade sanctions. The loan facility provided financing to the buyer to purchase the locomotives. This financing enabled the American company to compete effectively with foreign companies that received similar support from their governments.
Case Study: The Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India
For example, ECGC provided financing to support the sale of Indian-made automobiles to a foreign buyer. The financing included a combination of ECGC's export credit insurance and a loan facility. The insurance covered both commercial and political risks, including the insolvency of the buyer or the imposition of trade sanctions. The loan facility provided financing to the buyer to purchase the automobiles. This financing enabled the Indian company to compete effectively with foreign companies that received similar support from their governments.
Benefits of Export Credit Agencies
• Increased Exports: ECAs provide financial support to both importers and exporters, which helps to increase exports by reducing the risks associated with international trade.
• Improved Competitiveness: ECAs provide financial support to both importers and exporters, which helps to improve competitiveness by reducing the risks associated with international trade.
• Increased Economic Growth: ECAs provide financial support to both importers and exporters, which helps to increase economic growth by reducing the risks associated with international trade.
Challenges of Export Credit Agencies
• Limited Resources: ECAs have limited resources, which can limit their ability to provide financial support to both importers and exporters.
• Political and Economic Instability: ECAs face challenges associated with political and economic instability in foreign countries, which can increase the risks associated with international trade.
• Competition from Other ECAs: ECAs face competition from other ECAs, which can limit their ability to provide financial support to both importers and exporters.
Future of Export Credit Agencies
The future of export credit agencies will be shaped by a number of factors, including technological advancements, changes in global trade policies, and the emergence of new competitors. ECAs will need to continue to innovate and provide value-added services to both importers and exporters in order to remain competitive.
The Relationship Between Export Credit Agencies and Trade Policy
Export credit agencies are often established by governments to promote national trade interests. As such, their activities are closely tied to trade policy. ECAs can influence trade policy by providing financial support to importers and exporters, which can affect the volume and composition of international trade. In addition, ECAs can also influence trade policy by providing a framework for governments to negotiate trade agreements.
The Impact of Export Credit Agencies on Trade Agreements and Negotiations
Export credit agencies can have a significant impact on trade agreements and negotiations. For instance, ECAs can provide a framework for governments to negotiate trade agreements by providing a basis for discussions on trade liberalization. ECAs can also influence trade agreements by providing a mechanism for governments to offer concessions to other countries. In addition, ECAs can provide a means for governments to enforce trade agreements by providing a framework for dispute resolution.
Case Study: The Impact of Export Credit Agencies on Trade Agreements
The World Trade Organization (WTO) provides a framework for governments to negotiate trade agreements. The WTO's Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement) sets out the rules for government subsidies. The SCM Agreement establishes that export credit practices are subject to the same rules as other forms of government subsidies. As a result, ECAs must comply with the SCM Agreement when providing financial support to importers and exporters.
The SCM Agreement requires that export credit practices be made available to all countries on an equal basis. This requirement is known as the "most favored nation" principle. The SCM Agreement also establishes that export credit practices must not be used to cause or threaten to cause adverse effects to the interests of other countries. The SCM Agreement provides a framework for governments to negotiate trade agreements by providing a basis for discussions on trade liberalization. For instance, the SCM Agreement provides a basis for governments to discuss the elimination of export subsidies.
The SCM Agreement also provides a mechanism for governments to offer concessions to other countries. For instance, governments can offer concessions to other countries by providing more favorable export credit terms. In addition, the SCM Agreement provides a means for governments to enforce trade agreements by providing a framework for dispute resolution. For instance, if a country believes that another country's export credit practices are inconsistent with the SCM Agreement, it can initiate a dispute settlement proceeding under the WTO's Dispute Settlement Understanding.
The SCM Agreement has had a significant impact on the activities of ECAs. For instance, the SCM Agreement has led to the elimination of export subsidies in many countries. In addition, the SCM Agreement has led to greater transparency in export credit practices. As a result, ECAs must now disclose their financial support to importers and exporters.
The SCM Agreement has also had a significant impact on trade negotiations. For instance, the SCM Agreement has been used as a basis for discussions on trade liberalization. In addition, the SCM Agreement has been used as a means for governments to offer concessions to other countries. For instance, governments can offer concessions to other countries by providing more favorable export credit terms.

Export Credit Agencies and Trade Finance - Challenges and Opportunities - Global Economic Trends
The global economy has a significant impact on the operations of export credit agencies and international trade. Economic downturns and trade wars can significantly affect the ability of export credit agencies to provide financing and insurance to support international trade. In this chapter, we will explore the challenges and opportunities that arise from these global economic trends.
Economic Downturns
Economic downturns can have a substantial impact on the operations of export credit agencies. During economic downturns, the risk of non-payment by importers increases, which can result in higher claims for the export credit agencies. This can lead to increased costs for the export credit agencies and potentially impact their ability to provide financing and insurance to support international trade.
For example, during the 2008 global financial crisis, many export credit agencies experienced a significant increase in claims. The German export credit agency, Euler Hermes, reported a 20% increase in claims in 2009 compared to 2008. Similarly, the Swedish export credit agency, EKN, reported a 40% increase in claims in 2009 compared to 2008. These increases in claims were primarily due to the higher risk of non-payment by importers during the economic downturn.
Trade Wars
Trade wars can also have a significant impact on the operations of export credit agencies. Trade wars can disrupt international trade by imposing tariffs and quotas on imported goods. This can result in higher costs for importers and potentially impact their ability to pay for goods. As a result, export credit agencies may experience higher claims during trade wars.
For example, the ongoing trade war between the United States and China has disrupted international trade. The imposition of tariffs on imported goods has resulted in higher costs for importers and potentially impacted their ability to pay for goods. As a result, export credit agencies may experience higher claims during this trade war.
Impact on Export Credit Agencies
Case Study: The Impact of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis on Export Credit Agencies
Case Study: The Impact of the Trade War between the United States and China on Export Credit Agencies
Despite the challenges posed by economic downturns and trade wars, export credit agencies can still provide financing and insurance to support international trade. Export credit agencies can provide financing and insurance to support international trade by providing credit facilities to importers and credit insurance to exporters. This can help to mitigate the risks associated with international trade and provide opportunities for importers and exporters to engage in international trade.
For example, during the 2008 global financial crisis, many export credit agencies increased their support for international trade. The German export credit agency, Euler Hermes, increased its support for international trade by 15% in 2009 compared to 2008. Similarly, the Swedish export credit agency, EKN, increased its support for international trade by 20% in 2009 compared to 2008. This increased support for international trade was primarily due to the higher demand for financing and insurance during the economic downturn.
Export Credit Agencies and Trade Finance - Challenges and Opportunities - Digitalization and Technology
Export credit agencies (ECAs) play a crucial role in facilitating international trade by providing credit insurance and other financial services to help mitigate the risks associated with exporting goods and services. The use of digitalization and technological advancements has significantly impacted the operations of ECAs and the broader trade finance ecosystem. This chapter explores the challenges and opportunities arising from the integration of digitalization and technology in export credit agencies and trade finance, including the use of blockchain and artificial intelligence.
• **Data Security and Privacy**: The use of digital platforms and technologies requires the collection and storage of large amounts of data, including sensitive information about companies, transactions, and individuals. Ensuring the security and privacy of this data is a significant challenge, particularly given the proliferation of cyber-attacks and data breaches in recent years.
• **Interoperability**: The use of different digital platforms and technologies by various stakeholders in the trade finance ecosystem can create interoperability issues, making it difficult to share information and conduct transactions efficiently.
• **Regulatory Uncertainty**: The use of digitalization and technology in trade finance is relatively new, and as such, there is uncertainty regarding how existing regulations will apply to new technologies and business models. This lack of regulatory clarity can create uncertainty and may hinder adoption.

Export Credit Agencies and Trade Finance - Regulatory and Compliance Issues - Anti-Bribery and Corruption
Export credit agencies (ECAs) play a crucial role in facilitating international trade by providing financing solutions to importers and exporters. These agencies are subject to various regulatory requirements, including anti-bribery and corruption laws. This chapter will discuss the regulatory environment governing ECAs, focusing on anti-bribery and corruption laws and regulations.
Regulatory Environment
Export credit agencies are subject to various regulatory requirements, including anti-bribery and corruption laws. These laws are designed to prevent corrupt practices in international business transactions. The regulatory environment governing ECAs is complex and constantly evolving. ECAs must comply with numerous laws and regulations, including those related to anti-bribery and corruption, export control, environmental regulations, and economic sanctions.
Anti-Bribery and Corruption Laws
Anti-bribery and corruption laws prohibit improper payments or offers of payments by one party to another party for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. These laws also impose accounting standards and requirements on corporations and their intermediaries which are intended to prevent such improper payments from occurring. The United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) is a landmark piece of legislation that generally prohibits covered entities and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials to obtain or retain business. The United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010 is another important anti-bribery law that imposes strict liability on companies for failing to prevent bribery by associated persons. These laws have been interpreted to apply to companies in a broad range of circumstances. In addition, many countries have enacted similar anti-bribery laws prohibiting such payments to foreign governments and their officials and imposing accounting standards on corporations which are intended to prevent such payments from occurring.
The regulatory environment governing ECAs is complex and constantly evolving. ECAs must comply with numerous laws and regulations, including those related to anti-bribery and corruption, export control, environmental regulations, and economic sanctions. These laws and regulations may impose significant civil, criminal, and reputational penalties on ECAs and their intermediaries for noncompliance. As a result, it is essential for ECAs to maintain adequate policies and procedures designed to prevent such conduct and to respond appropriately to allegations of such conduct.

• **Knowledge Sharing**: ECAs can share knowledge and best practices in areas such as risk assessment, claims handling, and compliance, leading to more efficient operations.
• **Global Standards**: ECAs can work together to establish global standards for export credit practices, enhancing the overall efficiency of the export credit process.
• **Global Reach**: ECAs can leverage their collective global presence to provide financing solutions to a broader range of exporters and importers.
• **Innovation**: Global cooperation can foster innovation in export credit practices, enabling ECAs to respond more effectively to changing market conditions and stakeholder needs.
Challenges to Global Cooperation
Despite the benefits of global cooperation, ECAs face several challenges, including:
• **Diverse Interests**: ECAs have diverse interests and priorities, which can make it challenging to find common ground.
• **Competitive Pressures**: ECAs often compete with each other to provide financing solutions to exporters and importers.
• **Regulatory Barriers**: ECAs are subject to varying regulatory requirements, which can create barriers to cooperation.
• **Cultural and Language Barriers**: ECAs operate in diverse cultural and linguistic environments, which can create challenges in communication and collaboration.
Case Study: The Berne Union
The Berne Union is an international association of export credit agencies, banks, and financial institutions. It was established in 1934 with the objective of facilitating international trade by providing a forum for the exchange of information on credit and investment risks pertaining to international trade. The Berne Union has over 80 member countries, representing approximately 95% of global export credit insurance. The association provides a platform for its members to share knowledge, best practices, and resources, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the export credit process.
The Berne Union has several initiatives aimed at promoting global cooperation among its members. These include:
• **Principles for Sustainable Lending Practices**: The Berne Union has developed principles for sustainable lending practices, which provide a framework for ECAs to ensure that their financing activities are environmentally and socially responsible.
• **The Berne Union's General Rules**: The Berne Union's General Rules provide a standardized framework for export credit practices, enabling ECAs to share risk and provide financing solutions more efficiently.
• **The Berne Union's Short-Term Credit Committee**: The Short-Term Credit Committee provides a platform for ECAs to share information on short-term credit risks, enabling them to manage risk more effectively.
• **The Berne Union's Medium-Long Term Credit Committee**: The Medium-Long Term Credit Committee provides a platform for ECAs to share information on medium-long term credit risks, enabling them to manage risk more effectively.
Global Cooperation Initiatives
Several initiatives have been launched to promote global cooperation among ECAs and other stakeholders in facilitating international trade. These include:
• **The International Working Group of Export Credit Agencies**: This group was established in 1994 to provide a forum for ECAs to discuss issues of common interest and to promote cooperation among its members.
• **The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) ECA Network**: This network was established in 2011 to promote cooperation among ECAs in the Asia-Pacific region.
• **The European Union's Export Credit Insurance Facility**: This facility was established in 2012 to provide a common framework for export credit insurance in the European Union.
• **The World Trade Organization's (WTO) Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures**: This agreement establishes rules for government support for exports and imposes disciplines on the use of export subsidies and other trade-distorting measures.
The future of export credit agencies will be shaped by several factors, including technological advancements, changing market conditions, and evolving stakeholder needs. To remain relevant, ECAs must continue to innovate and adapt to changing market conditions. Key trends shaping the future of ECAs include:
• **Digitalization**: ECAs are leveraging digital technologies to enhance the efficiency of their operations, improve customer service, and reduce costs.
• **Sustainable Financing**: ECAs are increasingly focusing on sustainable financing practices, which consider environmental and social impacts alongside financial returns.
• **Global Cooperation**: ECAs must continue to engage in global cooperation to share knowledge, best practices, and resources, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the export credit process.
